## **Description**
Several species of Australian acacias have been enlisted as invasive species in several countries due to their ability to overcome direct and indirect effects of weather disturbances (e.g. forest fires, acidification and nitrification of soils etc.). In this study, worldwide species distribution models for *acacia sp.* (*Acacia melanoxylon* and *Acacia dealbata*) were developed for several climatic periods (1963-1993 and 1993-2023). For comparison, *Quercus Robur* was also modelled for the same periods as it is a natural species in some of the places where *Acacia sp.* is invasive (e.g. in Europe) 

The results of this study consist of 4 NetCDF files with the modelled distribution probabilities of *Acacia sp.* and *Quercus robur* in the periods 1963-1993 and 1993-2023. Each layer of the files correspond to each one of the folds in the cross-validation training of the model. The files found in this repository are as follows:

  ***acacia_1963to1993.nc***: Probability of distribution of *Acacia sp.* in the period from 1963 to 1993.

  ***acacia_1993to2023.nc***: Probability of distribution of *Acacia sp.* in the period from 1993 to 2023.

  ***qrobur_1963to1993.nc***: Probability of distribution of *Quercus robur* in the period from 1963 to 1993.

  ***qrobur_1993to2023.nc***: Probability of distribution of *Quercus robur* in the period from 1993 to 2023.
